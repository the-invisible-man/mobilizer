The mobilizer package is an open-sourced grass roots activism platform built on top the the Laravel Framework. It includes an HTML version of all pages as well as a RESTful API for creating a fancy SPA.

This repository is only the CRUD of the system, for a fully functional platform you will need to pull the Mobilizer-Python-Data repository which includes all mathematical algorithms for expanding and manipulating geospatial points as well as Elasticsearch synchronization. Our Python data repo is currently not public.
